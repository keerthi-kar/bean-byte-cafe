            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Americano coffee is a smooth and bold espresso-based drink that's diluted with hot water, giving it a
                rich
                flavor without the bitterness of straight espresso. It's perfect for those who enjoy deep coffee notes
                with
                a lighter feel. Whether you're starting your day or taking a break, an Americano brings a calm and
                classy
                coffee experience.</p>

            <p>Americano isn't just about taste-it's a smart choice too. With no milk or sugar, it's light on calories
                and
                easy on the stomach. It keeps you refreshed, supports digestion, and is a go-to drink for people who
                want to
                stay active and alert without feeling heavy.</p>
